UE4 Build Scripts
=================

These scripts build Unreal Engine 4 game projects using the engine source code provided by Epic on github. They do so by performing the following 3 steps:

1. Clone a fresh copy of the engine from github.
2. Extract the required files provided by Epic to the engine directory.
3. Run Unreal Automation Tool to build the game, cook the content and package it.
